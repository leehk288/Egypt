        <p><strong>Egypt today</strong> is made up of 90% muslims, 9% orthodox christians and 1% jewish. While very few but growing, identify as atheist or non-religious. So for now, 
          the principles of Islam guides Egyptian politics, economic activity and social life. Religious tolerance does not seem to be common practice throughout Egypt. The government
          must officially recognize a religion for it to be practiced freely and this official recognition is obtained by submitting a request to the Department of Religious Affairs.
          If individuals are found practicing an unrecognized religion, they may be arrested, persecuted, and punished.
          Non-Muslim groups have experienced instances of persecution and discrimination such as the Christian communities and Jewish despite both of them being legally recognized religions.
          Egypt's daily newspaper prints 5 designated times to pray throughtout the day and Egypt's government agencies and businesses observe every Islamic holiday. 
          Every institution (expect for emergency ones) is closed down on fridays because that's Islam's holy day. The majority of Egyptians do not touch alcohol because in Islam, 
          alcohol is forbidden. While alchohol is not illegal in Egypt, drinking it in public (anywhere besides a bar, restaurant or your home) is a taboo and in some cases and even
        lead to arrest. Now I will be talking more about culture such as familly, household structures and marriage instead of Islam's influences. Family is a very significant 
        aspect of life for the Egyptian people and society. Since Egypt is a largely collectivist society, the needs of one’s family or community typically is considered more important over one’s 
        personal needs or desires. It is common for Egyptians to live with their extended family and often one will find three generations living together. Grown-up unmarried kids
         (often the eldest son or daughter) tend to stay with their parents until they marry and newlywed women tend to leave their parents home to live with in-laws. The authority of the family 
        tends to lie with the eldest in the household, regardless of gender. Though typically the household structure is patriachal, the senior male. Since majority of Egyptian society is conversative
        men tend to have more influence than women in terms of decision-making and there is a general expectation for women to fulfil traditional roles such as raising children and household labour.
        Dating is not a common practice because the idea of purity, especially for women, is an important asset in marriage arrangements. In Egyptian society, 
        individuals have more decision-making power over who they marry than they did in the past but still involves arrangements among family members and may include the use of a matchmaker.
        Typically egyptians marry those within the same age group, level of education, social class and religion.</p>
